RIQ (launched by IHC with BlackRock and Lunate; ADGM-based and progressing toward FSRA authorization) can provide quota share and excess-of-loss capacity to primary insurers and MGAs in MENA and high-growth regions.",
        "example": "Example 1: A GCC commercial property insurer cedes 25% quota share on an industrial property portfolio with USD 320M annual GWP. RIQ provides USD 80M capacity, uses satellite and hazard data to refine flood/fire pricing, and structures a cat XoL layer to protect frequency and severity. Value: expands the cedant\u2019s underwriting capacity and stabilizes combined ratio while RIQ grows premium toward its USD 500M target. Example 2: A Southeast Asia motor telematics MGA seeks a 20% quota share plus a 110%\u2013120% aggregate stop-loss on USD 200M GWP. RIQ\u2019s AI uses trip-level telematics to segment risk and improves rate adequacy by 3\u20135 pts. Value: MGA scales faster with disciplined capital; RIQ diversifies into profitable, data-rich motor risk.",
