        "description": "IHC, after acquiring and rebranding eFunder into Zelo, offers a fully digital and automated invoice financing platform that addresses the $250 billion SME credit gap in MENA. The platform, licensed and regulated by the ADGM FSRA, provides liquidity within 24-48 hours by converting approved invoices into working capital, targeting key sectors such as construction, logistics, healthcare, industrial services, and oil & gas.",
        "example": "A logistics company facing a 90-day payment cycle from its clients can partner with Zelo to access immediate funds against approved invoices, enabling them to maintain cash flows and reinvest for growth. Similarly, a healthcare provider awaiting insurance payments could leverage Zelo\u2019s platform to secure near-instant working capital rather than waiting weeks or months, which is highly valuable for covering payroll or procuring medical supplies.",
