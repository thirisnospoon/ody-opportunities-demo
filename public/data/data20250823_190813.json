        "description": "IHC's strategic partnership with RIQ centers on deploying AI-native risk transfer solutions and structured reinsurance coverage exceeding USD 500 million over 10 years, targeting IHC's portfolio of subsidiaries across various industries. RIQ, supported by IHC, BlackRock, and Lunate, will leverage AI and advanced analytics to tailor capital-efficient coverage, focusing on complex Specialty and Property & Casualty risks. This opens new doors for companies seeking innovative, data-driven reinsurance models, especially those with complicated or evolving risk profiles.",
        "example": "A large logistics operator within the IHC group could partner with RIQ to create a custom AI-driven parametric insurance program for cargo and supply chain disruptions. Healthcare providers in the IHC portfolio could utilize RIQ's advanced analytics for optimized medical malpractice or business interruption reinsurance, reducing premiums and improving claims handling speed thanks to automated AI-based underwriting. External companies (for example, major construction firms or fintech scale-ups) operating in the Middle East could approach RIQ to access similar next-gen reinsurance products that address risks unique to their sectors (e.g., cyber or climate risk models powered by AI).",
        "roadmap": [
            "Step 1: Identify and assess sectors/subsidiaries within or outside IHC that have complex or underinsured Specialty and P&C risks.",
            "Step 2: Collaborate with RIQ to design bespoke AI-powered reinsurance solutions aligned to unique risk data and operational needs.",
            "Step 3: Conduct regulatory and risk model validation and secure necessary authorizations.",
            "Step 4: Implement tailored reinsurance solutions into companies\u2019 risk management frameworks.",
            "Step 5: Monitor performance, adjust models/data inputs, and expand solution offerings to new geographies or risk classes as needed."

This infrastructure is valuable for startups or established tech firms in insurance and financial services that lack the resources to develop state-of-the-art risk transfer and capital deployment mechanisms. By plugging into RIQ, startups can offer cutting-edge insurance and risk management products or collaborate on data-sharing and technology pilots.",
        "example": "An emerging insurtech company in the UAE could partner with RIQ to utilize its AI models and reinsurance capacity for launching micro-insurance products for gig economy workers. A fintech company specializing in SME lending could leverage RIQ's infrastructure to embed insurance against credit defaults or cyber risks into its platforms, sharing data streams to power advanced risk models.",
