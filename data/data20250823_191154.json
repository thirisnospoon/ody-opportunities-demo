        "description": "IHC has signed an MoU with Lunate to explore enrolling itself and its over 1,200 subsidiaries in the Ghaf Benefits platform, an alternative end-of-service benefits fund solution. Ghaf Benefits, managed by Lunate and regulated by SCA and MoHRE, offers a mix of investment funds (including Shariah-compliant options) for employees\u2019 end-of-service gratuities. This presents a real opportunity for companies under IHC and others in similar markets to upgrade employee benefits management, improve financial security for their staff, and enhance talent retention.",
        "example": "A healthcare company owned by IHC could use the Ghaf Benefits platform to manage end-of-service gratuities for its nurses and doctors, providing them investment-based financial growth instead of traditional lump sum payouts. Similarly, a real estate subsidiary could transition its employee gratuity scheme to Ghaf Benefits, offering both conventional and Shariah-compliant fund options, making the company more attractive for talent acquisition and retention in line with UAE employment trends.",
        "roadmap": [
            "step 1: IHC and Lunate finalize the cooperation agreement for rolling out Ghaf Benefits across IHC\u2019s subsidiaries.",
            "step 2: Each subsidiary\u2019s HR/finance teams are trained on the Ghaf Benefits\u2019 onboarding and management tools.",
            "step 3: Subsidiaries migrate existing end-of-service liabilities into Ghaf Benefits-managed funds.",
            "step 4: Employees are educated on their new benefit options and can select preferred fund types (conventional or Shariah-compliant).",
            "step 5: IHC and its subsidiaries monitor scheme performance and periodically review enhancement/expansion opportunities.",
            "step 6: Strategic communication used to attract new talent and increase employee satisfaction via modern, flexible benefit schemes."
